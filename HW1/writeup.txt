Rotation
--------
Usage: HW01_Image_Rotation <path_to_image.jpg>
Output: Displays the input image rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Press any key to exit.

This one is pretty straightforward. Open the image and rotate it 90 degrees around the center while maintaining the scaling. I display it in an 800x800 window. For input validation, I ensure that the filename is provided, ends with ".jpg", and that it can be read as an image. 

Video Display
-------------
Usage: HW01_VideoDisplay
Prereq: The videos to play are in a folder named "videos" in the same folder as the executable.
Output: Each video in ./videos/ plays for 3 seconds then closes.

This one was also fairly straightforward. It opens ./videos/ and attempts to treat every file in that directory as a video file and play it at its native fps for 3 seconds. If the directory doesn't exist or a file isn't able to be played as a video, it prints an appropriate error message and then exits.
On my system (Ubuntu 16.04), all the videos played without any issues.

Steganography
-------------
Usage: HW01_Steganography
Prereq: The file "CAT_Kitten_img_13.jpg" needs to be in the same directory as the executable.
Output: For each color channel (blue, green, red, in that order), it displays the image at each bitplane, lowest to highest. Press any key to go on to the next bitplane.

Message: THE DOG HOWLS AT THE MOON
The message was found on the green channel on the 3rd lowest bitplane.
